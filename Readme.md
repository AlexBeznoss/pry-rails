# Description

This fork of the **fork https://github.com/sumskyi/pry-rails**.

Its only made for rails 7 (`rails7` branch) and ruby version >= 2.3.

Other versions have not been tested and it is not known if they work.

Currently, as a test, the new `show-notes` command has been added.

The reason for this fork is to make **pry-rails** load only if environment variable set (`PRY=1` or `PRY=true`).

# Prerequisites

- A Rails >= 7.0 Application
- Ruby >= 2.3

# Installation

Add this line to your gemfile:

    gem 'pry-rails', group: :development, git: 'https://github.com/AlexBeznoss/pry-rails', branch: 'rails7'

`bundle install` and enjoy pry.

## Custom Rails prompt

If you want to permanently include the current Rails environment and project name
in the Pry prompt, put the following lines in your project's `.pryrc`:

```ruby
Pry.config.prompt = Pry::Prompt[:rails]
```

If `.pryrc` could be loaded without pry-rails being available or installed,
guard against setting `Pry.config.prompt` to `nil`:

```ruby
if Pry::Prompt[:rails]
  Pry.config.prompt = Pry::Prompt[:rails]
end
```

Check out `change-prompt --help` for information about temporarily
changing the prompt for the current Pry session.

## Enable pry-rails

Reason for this fork is to make pry-rails to be loaded only when requested. So in order to start rails console with pry next environment variable should be set:

```shell
PRY=1 rails console # or PRY=true rails console
```

Note that you may need to run `spring stop` first.

# Developing and Testing

This repo uses [Roadshow] to generate a [Docker Compose] file for each
supported version of Rails (with a compatible version of Ruby for each one).

To run specs across all versions, you can either [get the Roadshow tool] and
run `roadshow run`, or use Docker Compose directly:

```
$ for fn in scenarios/*.docker-compose.yml; do docker-compose -f $fn run --rm scenario; done

# only rails 7
$ for fn in scenarios/rails70.docker-compose.yml; do sudo docker-compose -f $fn run --rm scenario; done
```

You can also manually run the Rails console and server on each version with
`roadshow run rake console` and `roadshow run rake server`, or run them on a
specific version with, e.g., `roadshow run -s rails40 rake console`.

To update the set of scenarios, edit `scenarios.yml` and run `roadshow
generate`, although the Gemfiles in the `scenarios` directory need to be
maintained manually.
